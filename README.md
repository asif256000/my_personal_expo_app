This is my first try at building an Expo app.

For the uninitiated, Expo is a framework built on React JS that can create app that works on Android, iOS and web.

This cross-platform flexibility is what attracted me to learn this technology and I plan to built an app to host my website, and then extend its use for multi-user support.
